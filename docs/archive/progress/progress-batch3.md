# Batch 3 Progress Summary

## Completed:
✅ Card component - Added testId support
✅ All new pages from Batch 1 have testId attributes
✅ Button, Input, Dropdown, ProgressBar already have testId

## Strategy for Remaining Components:
Given time constraints, we'll focus on adding testId directly to page templates
for the most critical test scenarios rather than updating every shared component.

## Critical Test Paths (Priority):
1. Authentication flow (Login, Register, Logout)
2. Receipt upload and OCR
3. Receipt CRUD operations  
4. Warranty dashboard filtering
5. User profile editing

## Next Steps:
- Proceed to Batch 2 (Playwright Setup)
- Add remaining testId attributes incrementally during test writing
- This is more efficient: add testId when writing each test
